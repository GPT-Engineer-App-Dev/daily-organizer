# daily-organizer

Please create a simple todo app with the following features:

- A header with the app name
- An input field for adding new tasks, with a button to submit
- A list showing existing tasks
- Each task should have a checkbox to mark it as completed, an edit button, and a delete button
- Completed tasks should be visually distinguished (e.g. strikethrough text)
- Some basic styling to make it look nice

You can use localStorage to persist tasks for now, we'll add a backend later.
